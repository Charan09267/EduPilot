                2. Questions should match the candidate's role.
                3. Cover the provided topics.

                9. Keep each question clear and concise.
                10. Number the questions sequentially starting from 1.

                IMPORTANT RESPONSE FORMAT:

                Return ONLY a valid JSON object.

                The JSON object MUST contain a field named "questions".

                The "questions" field MUST be an array of objects.

                Each question object MUST contain exactly these two fields:

                - "questionNumber": the sequential question number.
                - "question": the actual interview question.

                The response MUST follow exactly this structure:

                {
                  "questions": [
                    {
                      "questionNumber": 1,
                      "question": "First interview question"
                    },
                    {
                      "questionNumber": 2,
                      "question": "Second interview question"
                    },
                    {
                      "questionNumber": 3,
                      "question": "Third interview question"
                    }
                  ]
                }

                Rules:

                - Generate exactly %d question objects.
                - questionNumber must start from 1.
                - questionNumber must increase sequentially.
                - Each question must be a string.
                - Do not return questions as plain strings.
                - Do not return a JSON array directly.
                - Do not add any fields other than "questions", "questionNumber", and "question".
                - Do not use markdown.
                - Do not include explanations outside the JSON.
                - Return valid JSON only.
